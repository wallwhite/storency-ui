## Import

Chakra UI exports 5 accordion-related components.

- `Accordion`: The wrapper that uses cloneElement to pass props to
  `AccordionItem` children.
- `AccordionItem`: A single accordion item.
- `AccordionButton`: The button that toggles the expand/collapse state of the
  accordion item. This button must be wrapped in an element with role `heading`.
- `AccordionPanel`: The container for the details to be revealed.
- `AccordionIcon`: A `chevron-down` icon that rotates based on the
  expanded/collapsed state
